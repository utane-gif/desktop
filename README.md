## What is this repository for?

This repository contains specific patches on top of the upstream
`desktop/desktop` repository to support Linux usage.

It also hosts preview packages for various Linux distributions:

 - AppImage (`.AppImage`)
 - Debian (`.deb`)
 - RPM (`.rpm`)
 - Snap (`.snap`) - also available from [snapcraft.io](https://snapcraft.io/github-desktop)

Check out the [latest releases](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/releases) to
help out with testing on your distribution.

### Snapcraft Store

We are currently testing out a new version of the Snap that requires using the
`classic` enclosure, as GitHub Desktop has integrations to launch your chosen
shell or editor which are not supported in the `strict` enclosure.

**If you are currently running the Snap installed from `edge`**

You will be prompted to manually upgrade to the `beta` channel as an installed
application cannot upgrade it's enclosure via an update.

To upgrade manually, run these commands:

```
$ snap remove github-desktop
$ snap install github-desktop --beta --classic
```

## Other Distributions

Arch Linux users can install GitHub Desktop from the
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/github-desktop-bin/).

`gnome-keyring` is required and the daemon must be launched either at login or when the X server is started. Normally this is handled by a display manager, but in other cases following the instructions found on the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNOME/Keyring#Using_the_keyring_outside_GNOME) will fix the issue of not being able to save login credentials.
