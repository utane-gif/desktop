## What is this repository for?

This repository contains specific patches on top of the upstream
`desktop/desktop` repository to support Linux usage.

It also hosts preview packages for various Linux distributions:

 - AppImage (`.AppImage`)
 - Debian (`.deb`)
 - RPM (`.rpm`)

Check out the [latest releases](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/releases) to
help out with testing on your distribution.

## Other Distributions

Arch Linux users can install GitHub Desktop from the
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/github-desktop-bin/).

`gnome-keyring` is required and the daemon must be launched either at login or when the X server is started. Normally this is handled by a display manager, but in other cases following the instructions found on the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNOME/Keyring#Using_the_keyring_outside_GNOME) will fix the issue of not being able to save login credentials.

## More information

Please check out the [README](https://github.com/desktop/desktop#github-desktop)
on the upstream [GitHub Desktop project](https://github.com/desktop/desktop) and
